        For example, say 1.0.0 is our current stable version, but we last released 2.0.0-rc1 so it's at the top of our changelog.
        If we select 2.0.0-rc1 then when we try to promote 2.0.0 to a stable release the version number would get incremented.
        automatically as part of the build (so for example 2.0.0-rc1 -> 2.0.1)
        Also if we had to do an emergency release of the latest stable version (e.g 1.0.0 -> 1.1.0) to patch a security
        issue then we wouldn't want to select our 2.0.0-rc1 pre-release version to base the new patch release off of.
        Therefore we select the last "stable" release which should always be what we want to work with.
        The exception to this is when we're performing a release, in which case we want to use the latest version regardless

.SYNOPSIS
    Sets the correct version number for a release
.DESCRIPTION
    This is done by looking at the last release and determining the next version number based on the type of release
    we're doing.

        Also occasionally we may want to republish a version that we've already released.

    publish to an endpoint that previously failed simply exclude the others.

    We create the module manifest as part of every build rather than storing it permanently.
    This is due to the fact that at the time of writing Update-ModuleManifest is somewhat limited so overwriting/updating

    Also it seems to be common practice with several other modules.

    Removes stale documentation files that do not correspond to a cmdlet in this module
.DESCRIPTION
    When two modules share the same cmdlet names (e.g. Brownserve.PSTools also exports Add-GitChanges),
    PlatyPS can pick up the wrong module from the docs directory and generate docs for all cmdlets in
    that module, polluting the docs directory with files that belong to the other module.
    This task removes any .md files in the docs directory that do not match a public cmdlet in this
    module or the module landing page (Commands.md), preventing the self-perpetuating corruption loop.

<#
    Below are the meta tasks that we use to build the module.
    These are the tasks that we'll actually call run this script via Invoke-Build.
    Dependent tasks will be run in the order they're defined.
    !! BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE ORDERING !!
#>

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Meta task for building the module.
.DESCRIPTION
    This task will run all the tasks required to build just the module.
    It doesn't build the documentation, NuGet package or perform any tests.
    This task is mostly here just to serve as a base for other tasks.
#>
task Build CreateModuleManifest, {}

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Meta task for building the module and importing it.
.DESCRIPTION
    This task will run all the tasks required to build the module and import it.
    It does not build the documentation, NuGet package or perform any tests as these can take some time to complete.
    This task is best used when developing new features locally as it allows you to quickly test your changes
    interactively.
#>
task BuildAndImport Build, ImportModule, {}

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Meta task for building the module along with the documentation.
.DESCRIPTION
    This task will run all the tasks required to build the module and generate the documentation.
    The documentation can take some time to generate, especially as it currently requires us to run a separate process
    to replace the line endings and format the markdown.
    This task is best ran after any local changes have largely been finalised as it will generate any documentation
    required.
#>
task BuildWithDocs BuildAndImport, CreateModuleHelp, {}

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Meta task for building and testing the module.
.DESCRIPTION
    This task performs the same actions as the previous tasks but also performs unit tests on the module.
    This task is best used to thoroughly test any changes before committing them.
#>
task BuildAndTest BuildWithDocs, Tests, {}

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Meta task for building and testing the module, then finally confirming there are no uncommitted changes.
.DESCRIPTION
    This task will build the module, perform unit tests on it and then ensure there are no uncommitted changes
    resulting from the build.
    This is the build we use for our pull_request CI pipeline and as such must pass before we can merge any changes.
#>
task BuildTestAndCheck BuildAndTest, CheckForUncommittedChanges, {}

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Meta task that prepares the module for release.
.DESCRIPTION
    This task will update the changelog and module documentation with the new version, commit those changes to a
    new branch and then create a pull request for merging the changes into the default branch.
    This allows us to review the changes and make any adjustments before we actually release them.
    We use this task in the stage_release CI pipeline.
#>
task StageRelease CheckStagingParameters, SetStagingVariables, CreateChangelogEntry, UpdateChangelog, UpdateModuleDocumentation, CreatePullRequest, {
    $BuildMessage = @"
The release has been successfully staged and a pull request has been created.
Please review the changes at $script:PRLink and merge if they look good.
If you need to make any changes please do so on the $script:StagingBranchName branch.
"@
    Write-Build Green $BuildMessage
}

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Meta task that stops just short of actually pushing a release
.DESCRIPTION
    This task will perform all the tasks required to release the module but will not actually push the release to the
    various endpoints.
    This is useful for testing the release process without actually releasing anything.
#>
task DryRun SetReleaseVariables, CheckPublishingParameters, CheckPreviousReleases, CompressModule, Tests, PackNuGetPackage, CheckForUncommittedChanges, {}

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Meta task that performs a release of the module.
.DESCRIPTION
    For a release the module is built, tested and then published to the various endpoints.
    Unlike other tasks the version number is not updated as part of the build as we expect it to already be set in the
    changelog.
    We use this task in the release CI pipeline.
#>
task Release CheckPublishingParameters, SetReleaseVariables, BuildAndTest, PublishRelease, {}
