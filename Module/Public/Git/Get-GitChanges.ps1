                As it stands the output of the git status --short command is the same as the porcelain version with the added bonus that the paths are
                relative to the working directory. The porcelain version of the command is more stable and is less likely to change in the future as it
                is designed to be used by scripts. The downside is that the paths are relative to the repository root and not the working directory.
                We make the conscious decision to use the --short version of the command by default and accept that it may change in the future necessitating
                a change to this function. We provide the -UsePorcelain switch to allow the user to use the more stable version of the command if they wish.
